  description: |
    Consolidated plan for reorganizing project documentation as Link Farm + Hub-and-Spoke
    with Progressive Disclosure. CLAUDE.md becomes a lightweight navigation hub linking to
    detailed specifications organized by topic. All references point to canonical sources
    for current capabilities, architecture, and workflows.

  # Hub-and-Spoke Overview
  hub_definition: |
    CLAUDE.md is the navigation hub providing:
    1. 50-line essentials overview (project purpose, core components)
    2. Quick navigation links to detailed documentation
    3. Progressive disclosure (essentials → deep dives)
    4. Single entry point for Claude Code users

  spoke_definition: |
    Each spoke is a detailed specification document covering one topic:
    - Located in appropriate docs/ subdirectory
    - Self-contained with complete information
    - Linked from CLAUDE.md hub
    - Version-tracked via OpenAPI/YAML format
    - Uses neutral language (no promotional terms)

  # Current Hub State (BEFORE reorganization)
  current_hub_structure:
    file: "CLAUDE.md"
    lines: 476
    issues:
      - "Too comprehensive (tries to cover everything)"
      - "Should be 50-70 lines maximum for quick navigation"
      - "Mixes essentials with deep technical details"
      - "Difficult to update when details change"
      - "No version tracking"

    current_topics_mixed:
      - "Architecture overview (essential)"
      - "Development commands (reference, not essential)"
      - "Data collection patterns (should be spoke)"
      - "CLI usage (should be spoke)"
      - "Python API (should be spoke)"
      - "Validation architecture (should be spoke)"
      - "SDK quality standards (should be spoke)"
      - "CI/CD integration (should be spoke)"
      - "Network architecture (should be spoke)"
      - "Authentication (should be spoke)"
