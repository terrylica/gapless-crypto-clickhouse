TEST COVERAGE VALIDATION - SUMMARY
v4.0.0 Release Candidate
Agent: Test Coverage Validation
Date: 2025-11-17
================================================================================

VERDICT: ⚠️ CAUTION - Conditional GO

QUICK STATS:
- Tests: 336 total (308 passed, 22 failed, 6 skipped)
- Pass Rate: 91.7%
- Coverage: 60% overall, 91% SDK entry points (exceeds 85% target)
- Execution Time: 4 minutes 17 seconds

FAILURE BREAKDOWN:
- Expected: 20 (CLI removed in v4.0.0 per design)
- Unexpected: 2 (1 environment issue, 1 trivial version check)

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
1. [BLOCKER] Old CLI entry point conflict
   - Impact: Users upgrading from v3.x
   - Mitigation: Add upgrade instructions to CHANGELOG
   - Status: Easily resolved with docs

2. [TRIVIAL] Version assertion outdated
   - Impact: One test expects '3.2.0' instead of '4.0.0'
   - Fix: One-line change in test_api_edge_cases.py:184
   - Status: Non-blocking

COVERAGE COMPLIANCE:
✅ api.py: 91% (target: 85%)
✅ __probe__.py: 95% (target: 85%)
✅ validation/storage.py: 89% (target: 70%)
✅ All SDK entry points exceed quality standards

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Fix version assertion (1 min)
2. Add CHANGELOG upgrade instructions (5 min)
3. Optional: Mark CLI tests as skipped (10 min)

RELEASE DECISION: APPROVE with mitigations
